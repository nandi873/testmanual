             variants (GT and GT S)</b><hr> in March 2015, while a GT3 racing variant of the car
             was introduced in 2015.<i> A high performance variant called the GT R was
            introduced in 2016. A GT4 racing variant</i>, targeted at semi-professional
             drivers and based on the GT R variant, was introduced in 2017. In 2021,
             a new variant called<br> the AMG GT Black Series was released.<hr> All
            variants are assembled at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Sindelfingen, Germany.<br>
            On 28 October 2021,<br> Mercedes-Benz announced the new Mercedes-AMG R232
            SL-Class as the direct successor for the roadster version.<br>
            The coupe version will be redesigned on the same platform as th
             2023 Mercedes AMG SL,<b> but will retain the name AMG GT.The interior
              of the Mercedes-AMG GT was previewed on 16 April 2014.</b>The car
               made its debut on 9 September 2014 and was officially unveiled to
                the public<hr> in October 2014 at the Paris Motor Show. The GT's exterior
                 design was kept similar to that of the preceding SLS AMG, with wide wheel
                  arches, lower<i> bodywork, and<br> fastback sloping roofline of the SLS AMG, bu
                  t using conventional forward-opening doors instead of the iconic gullwing
                   style pioneered</i>i by the 300 SL in the 1950s. It also employed an upgraded
                    and shortened version of the Transaxle<br> Spaceframe platform used by the SLS.
             The vehicle structure is made up of 93% aluminium, with the front module base made
              up of magnesium.<hr><br> The exterior lead designer was Mark Fetherston, whose previous
               works include the W176 A-Class, the CLA-Class, and SLS AMG. The interior, designed by Jan Kaul, features a large centre console and decorative elements in a leather and carbon polymer design.[9] The trunk offers room for a medium-sized suitcase.             
             Two engine power output options were offered: the GT, with 340 kW (462 PS; 456 hp),
              and the GT S with 375 kW (510 PS; 503 hp) The GT generates 600 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft) of
               torque, and the GT S generates 650 N⋅m (479 lb⋅ft) of torque.            
             Shortly after its introduction, Mercedes-AMG CEO at the time, Tobias Moers promised a
              Black Series variant of the Mercedes-AMG GT.[15] The new high performance variant was called the AMG GT R.</p>
